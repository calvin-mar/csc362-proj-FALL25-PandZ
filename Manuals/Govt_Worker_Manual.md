# Government Worker Manual

This manual discusses how a government worker in the planning and zoning office can interact with this webpage system. There are two sets of priveleges for roles associated with the government worker: regular privileges and admin privileges. For most aspects these roles are identical, but when special admin privileges apply, this manual will designate that section with ADMIN: and _italics_. 

A government worker must have an account to be able to interact with the system. A department account has access to a wide variety of forms, thus this type of account cannot be created from the login page. Rather the necessary credentials must given to the user by an admin account.

nce the department user logs in, they are directed to a dashboard. There are either two or three notable features on this page: the navbar, ADMIN: _Admin Actions_, and All Forms.

## Navbar
The navbar contains three buttosn: "Manage Account", "Logout", and "Reports". The logout button simply removes current session information and redirects back to the login page. 

### Manage Account Page
Manage Account directs the user to a page titled "Manage Your Account". On this page the user may change their saved email or their password. Both options require retyping for confirmation before changing the attribute.

Finally, there is an option to delete the account. This also requires confirmation before deletion. 

### Reports
Reports directs to a page that contains various statistics about all submitted forms, in particular in contains information about all-time forms, corrections, and departments.

## ADMIN: _Admin Actions_
_Admin users have the ability to create new government worker and new department accounts. This section when expanded has two possible forms. The first is Create New Department, which asks for the necessary information to create a department. Similarly there is Create Government Worker Account, which asks for the necessary information (such as username, password, email) to make a new government worker account. Once the information for either account is filled out, clicking the green create button at the bottom of the card adds the account and may be logged in to._

## All Forms
Below this section all forms may be viewed order by the id number of the form, which tends to correspond with the date submitted, i.e. form 3 is likely to have been submitted earlier than form 12. The forms are displayed in a table with a basic summary of status. The details may be viewed by the "View Details" button, which shows all of the information from the form including all interactions associated with the form from all departments and corrections given to the form.

When viewing a form through this method government workers have three actions that they may take for this form. Forms may be paid, resolved, or correctd.

### Paying Forms
Once forms have been paid by some method, the form should be marked as paid by selecting the payment method from the dropdown menu and checking the box below it. Once that is filled out, the button "Update Payment" status should be clicked. 

Conversely, if a form was mistakenly marked as paid, the box may be unchecked at the update resubmitted. 

### Resolving Forms
Once the application that the form is relevant for is completed, then the form should be marked as resolved. Marking a form as resolved indicates that its purpose has passed and progress no longer needs to be monitored. Once the date is entered, the "Mark as Resolved" button should be clicked.

Similarly if a form was mistakenly marked as resolved, then the form may be either unmakred as reolved or if the date was erroneous, it may be changed and reupdated. This uses the "Update Resolution Date" or "Mark as Unresolved" respectively.

### Correcting Forms
Finally, the government worker also has the ability to add corrections to the form. If a user needs to make corrections, they may be notified by adding a correction at the bottom of this page. By clicking "Add Correction" button, the government worker is directed to a page to write their correction. This requires the reviewer's name and the description for the correction. Once this is written, the "Submit Correction" button may clicked to add it to the form.
