# Department User Manual
This manual discusses how a user associated with a department may interact with the webpage system of this project. The department user may be a user associated with any department that interacts with the planning and zoning forms, such as the the board of engineers, legislative board, and other safety boards. 

A client must have an account to be able to interact with the system. A department account has access to a wide variety of forms, thus this type of account cannot be created from the login page. Rather the necessary credentials must given to the user by an admin account.

Once the department user logs in, they are directed to a dashboard. There are two notable features on this page: the navbar and the submitted forms. 

## Navbar
The navbar contains three buttosn: "Manage Account", "Logout", and "Reports". The logout button simply removes current session information and redirects back to the login page. 

### Manage Account Page
Manage Account directs the user to a page titled "Manage Your Account". On this page the user may change their saved email or their password. Both options require retyping for confirmation before changing the attribute.

Finally, there is an option to delete the account. This also requires confirmation before deletion. 

### Reports
Reports directs to a page that contains various statistics about all submitted forms, in particular in contains information about all-time forms such as all interactions, recent interactions, and breakdowns. 

## Submitted Forms and Interactions
The primary feature for departments is viewing forms and interacting with forms. Near the top of the page, there is a filter forms menu. The department user may decide to view pending or resolved forms, forms of a specific type, or forms within a range of dates. Applying the appropriate filters in the menu and clicking "Apply Filters" will display the appropriate information. Clicking "Clear Forms" will reset the menu and display all forms indiscriminately.


### Forms Table
Below this section all forms may be viewed order by the id number of the form, which tends to correspond with the date submitted, i.e. form 3 is likely to have been submitted earlier than form 12. The forms are displayed in a table with a basic summary of status. The details may be viewed by the "View Details" button, which shows all of the information from the form including all interactions associated with the form from all departments.

### Interactions
Interactions may be added to forms in two places. A department user may add user from the table summary viewable from the dashboard via the "Add Interaction" button on the right side of the table. Alternatively, when viewing a form on the form page, there is an option to add a new interaction at the bottom of the page. 

Department interactions are a tool for departments to inform clients about the behind the scenes of planning and zoning. Adding interactions to forms allows the client to see the steps that occur while a form is being process instead of having to wait in the dark for weeks. The purpose of using these forms is to increase transparency in the process and improve client confidence.
